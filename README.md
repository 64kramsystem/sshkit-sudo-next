# SSHKit::Sudo ("next" version)

Fork of the [SSHKit::Sudo](https://github.com/kentaroi/sshkit-sudo.git) project, with significant cleanups and some improvements.

As the original project, this gem allows:

- sudo commands with password support;
- perform all the tasks of a given session (eg. a whole deploy) as a specified user.

We're in the process of preparing and releasing thorough documentation (estimated time: beginning of May/2021).
